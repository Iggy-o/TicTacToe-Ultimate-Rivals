# TicTacToe: Ultimate Rivals
V1.4.3 - This is my first major personal program, started in January 2020 during my junior year(highschool) as a sideproject. However, I became really involved in the project and eventually spent all my time on the project and continued to work on it even in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic. The project has taught me alot along the way about web development, javascript, css, html, responsive design, algorithms, and so much more.Please feel free to leave any critiques. Enjoy!
